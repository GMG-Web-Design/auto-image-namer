The right side, labeled \"before,\" displays the same seat fabric but with significant discoloration, visible dirt, and darkened areas, indicating heavy soiling. The fabric pattern is a subtle herringbone, and the seat design includes stitched seams and a contoured shape.

The focus is on the stream of water hitting the wheel, creating a visible mist and splash effect. The car is black or dark-colored, and the wheel features a multi-spoke alloy rim.
