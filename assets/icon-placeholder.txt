ICON PLACEHOLDER

To complete the desktop app setup, you'll need to create icon files:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG icon and save as: assets/icon.png
2. For macOS: Convert to ICNS format and save as: assets/icon.icns  
3. For Windows: Convert to ICO format and save as: assets/icon.ico

Suggested icon design:
- Camera/photo icon with a gear/settings symbol
- Blue gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- White icon elements
- Modern, clean design

You can use online converters or tools like:
- png2ico.com (for ICO conversion)
- cloudconvert.com (for ICNS conversion)
- Or design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop

For now, the app will work without icons (they'll just be default Electron icons).
